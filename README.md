# Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to my collection of solutions to Project Euler problems! This repository contains my attempts to solve various problems from the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) website.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. New problemms are added every week, and they range in difficulty from fairly straightforward to extremely difficult.

## Structure of the Repository

Each solution is contained within its own file, named according to the problem number. For example, the solution to Problem 1 is in `prob_1.py`, Problem 2 in `prob_2.py`, and so on.

## Getting Started

To run any of the solutions, you will need Python installed on your computer. To the best of my ability, I try to avoid using any libraries like `numpy` or `math`.

### Running a Solution

To run a solution, use the following command in your terminal:

```
python prob_<number>.py
```

Replace `<number>` with the problem number you want to run.

### Example

To run the solution for Problem 1, use:

```
python prob_1.py
```
